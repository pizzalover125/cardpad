Time Spent: 2 hours

I saw this post on Reddit while doing some research, https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1g51zhl/credit_card_sized_macropad/, and wanted to recreate it! So I got started. I initially speedran it and got a time of 22 minutes. I could definetly speed that up, but its whatever. I made a simple 3x3 matrix, but it was kind of boring so I wanted to do something better.

I resumed my work, aiming for something more complicated. I decided to add an IO extender, something I had never done before. Fourtunately, it wasn't too bad because a lot of people in #hackpad tried something similar, so I could learn from their mistakes. I decided to make it a business card. idk why. Here is my final PCB (w/ 0 vias!).
